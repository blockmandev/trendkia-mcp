TrendKia MCP server
===================
Exposes TrendKia (https://trendkia.com) content to any MCP-compatible AI
(Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) as a small set of tools.

The site is already AI-friendly: every article URL has a clean `.md`, `.txt`
and `.json` version. So this server fetches the `.md` version for article
content instead of scraping HTML.

Tools exposed:
  - list_recent_articles : newest posts from /feed.xml
  - search_articles      : keyword search over the feed (title + summary + category)
  - get_article          : clean markdown text of one article
  - list_sitemap_urls    : every URL from /sitemap.xml (handles sitemap indexes)

Run:  python trendkia_mcp.py
